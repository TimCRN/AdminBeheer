# Database

This project uses a local MySQL database that runs in a docker container. This database is created from migrations that are defined in the app. The app also seeds the database with some standard values.

You can connect with the local database via localhost on port 3306, ***but make sure that the mysql container is running in docker!***
The credentials for this db is as follows:

- username: root
- password: secret

These credentials are, ofcourse, different and serializeed in the production environment and are only used for local testing.

You can also access the database via the browser. This can be accessed via http://localhost:8080/.
